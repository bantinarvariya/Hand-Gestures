# Hand-Gestures
INTRODUCTION This project implements a hand recognition and hand gesture recognition system utilizing OpenCV on Python.<br/>
A histogram based approach is utilized to isolate out a hand from the background picture. background cancellation strategies are utilized to acquire ideal outcomes. The gestures are recognized by angle of hull, contours and hull logic. <br/>
Platform: Python<br/> 
Libraries: OpenCV 2, Numpy, math, pygame, time <br/>
Hardware Requirements:  Webcam <br/>
USAGE: Run handgesture.py to begin the program.
